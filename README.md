# Collector

This tool can collect different artifact on running system.

Like a kape but faster, more secure and open source in rust ü¶Ä.

## üèóÔ∏è Build Poject

You need to install [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/fr/tools/install) on you computer.

You can use this following command to run the project for test:

```bash
cargo run --bin collector_cli -- -h
```

Or build in production mode:

```bash
cargo build --release --bin collector_cli
```

#### Build under Linux

It's able to build rust project under linux to windows.
To do that execute the following command 
```bash
apt-get install gcc-mingw-w64-x86-64 -y
apt-get install gcc -y
apt-get install build-essential -y
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
```
after that you can build the project for example:
```bash
cargo build --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu --bin collector_packer --release
```

## Run collector

The project is build to easy to run.
You can just start the binary and the process go to start.

- [ ] Export to VHDX

## üñºÔ∏è Next project

At the end of this project, I developping a GUI to interact easier with the binary.
